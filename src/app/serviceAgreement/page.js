          time, the Transfer route, the number of passengers, vehicle class,
          etc.) by the User shall be considered as the cancellation of the
          Transfer initiated by the User, and the Carrier has the right to
          refuse to perform the Transfer in accordance with the changed
          conditions. Refund for the Transfer, the essential terms of which have
          been changed by the User, is carried out in accordance with clause
          4.2.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1.1. Carrier's Refusal</h3>
        <p>
          If the Carrier refuses to provide the Transfer, the User has the right
          to accept the offer of another Carrier or cancel the Transfer.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          The funds transferred by the User to the account of the Company as a
          payment for the Transfer Price shall be indicated in the User's
          Personal Account and available for payment for other Transfers in the
          following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            (A) The User cancels the Transfer booked while having the Flexible
            access to their Personal Account or changes its essential terms
            within the cancellation period specified for the access level chosen
            by the User;
          </li>
          <li>
            (B) The User cancels the Transfer booked with Flexible access to
            their Personal Account before its start due to the Carrier’s failure
            to comply with the vehicle tracking clause specified in the Offer;
          </li>
          <li>
            (C) The Transfer is cancelled by the Carrier or the Company,
            excluding the cases when the Transfer was fulfilled by another
            Carrier;

          <li>
            (D) The User cancels the Transfer booked before April 25, 2023,
            without reference to such Transfers’ starting date and time or the

            48 hours before the agreed pick-up time.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in all other cases
          specified in sec. 8.1. (G) hereunder, the amounts received as payment
          for the Transfers shall be returned by means of indicating the amount
          due in the User's Personal Account. Such amount may be used for
          payment for other Transfers or returned to the User's bank account
          upon the end of the force-majeure at the User’s request.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3. Payment Return Request</h3>
        <p>
          The request for the return of funds paid as the Transfer Price can be
          (in case the Transfer Price was paid in physical cash) required by the
          User directly to the Carrier. The User hereby admits and agrees that
          the Company accepts funds from the User solely for the purpose of
          transferring them to the Carriers in order to pay for the Transfers
          and is not entitled to independently manage such funds, therefore the
          Company cannot make refunds to the User. The Company does not
          participate in settlement of disputes between the Carrier and the User
          that are connected with the payment of the Transfer Price by physical
          cash, including any issues related to complete or partial refund of
          such amounts to the User.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4. No Payment Return for No-Show</h3>
        <p>
          No payment return (full or prepayment) is allowed in case the User or
          another passenger on whose behalf the User placed an order does not
          show up at an agreed place of the Transfer at the pick-up time nor
          within the following time frames:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            60 minutes from the pick-up time agreed at the airports, sea, or
            river passenger port terminals;
          </li>
          <li>30 minutes at the railway stations;</li>
          <li>15 minutes at all other places from the pick-up time agreed;</li>
          <li>
            5 minutes regardless of the agreed pick-up place if the Request for
            such Transfer was placed in the Service by the User no more than 30
            minutes before the agreed pick-up time;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, no refund is provided if the User brought forward
          Special Cargo for the Transfer which transportation was not agreed or
          if the cargo is forbidden to be carried.

          (and any costs incurred in connection therewith):

          10.1. The User agrees to receive advertising messages from the
          Company. The User has a right to decline receiving advertising
          messages by using the relevant functionality of the Service, as part

        <p>
          10.3. The User hereby gives the User's consent on processing and

        </p>

        <h2>11. PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION</h2>
        <p>
          11.1. Discrimination refers to any distinction, exclusion, restriction
          or preference in the rights and freedoms of an individual or a group
          of individuals, as well as support for discriminatory behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
          11.2. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7
          December 2000 establishes the Inadmissibility of Discrimination, in
          particular article 21, paragraph 1, contains the following: "Any
          discrimination, in particular on grounds of sex, race, colour, ethnic
          or social origin, genetic traits, language, religion or belief,
          political or any other views, membership of a national minority,
          property status, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation."
          Paragraph 2 once again emphasizes that "any discrimination based on
          nationality is prohibited". Racial Equality Directive 2000/43/EC
          establishes a ban on all forms of racial discrimination; Gender
          Equality Directive 2006/54/EC (in relation to employment) establishes
          the equality of men and women, prohibits discrimination on the basis
          of sex. The prohibition of discrimination is the basic principle of
          international law, recognized and actively supported by the entire
          world community.
        </p>

        <p>
          11.3. When using the Service, the User shall be tolerant and not
          specify any requirements of a discriminatory nature, in particular the
          requirement that the transportation Service be provided by a Carrier
          of a certain sex, race, nationality, sexual orientation. If the User
          indicates discriminatory requirements, the Company reserves the right
          to reject the request and terminate the Agreement with the User (block
          the access to the Personal Account).
        </p>

        <h2>12. ASSIGNMENT AND NOVATION</h2>
        <p>
          12.1. The Company may assign, transfer, novate or otherwise deal in
          any manner, all or any part of the benefit of this Agreement and any
          of its rights, remedies, powers, duties and obligations under this
          Agreement to any person, without the User’s consent and in any way the
          Company considers appropriate.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.2. The User agrees that it may not transfer any assignee,
          transferee or any other person who has an interest in this Agreement,
          any right of set off or other rights that the User has against the
          Company.
        </p>

        <h2>13. TERM AND PROCEDURE OF TERMINATION</h2>
        <p>
          13.1. This Agreement will commence at the moment specified in clause
          1.1 and shall continue until terminated in accordance with this
          section 13.
        </p>

        <p>
          13.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
          Company may at any time and for any reason immediately terminate this
          Agreement as between the User and it without prior notice or need to
          specify reasons, including if:

        <ul>
          <li>
            (A) the User has breached any provision of this Agreement or acted
            in a manner which clearly shows that the User does not intend to or
            is unable to comply with any provision in this Agreement;
          </li>
          <li>
            (B) the Company reasonably considers it is required to do so by the
            application of any laws or regulations or by any government,
            quasi-government, authority or public body (including any regulatory
            body of any jurisdiction); or
          </li>
          <li>
            (C) the Company determines that performing its obligations under
            this Agreement is no longer commercially viable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          13.3. The Company will inform the User of such termination by notice
